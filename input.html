                  Storage
Supabase Storage makes it simple to store and serve large files.

Files#
Files can be any sort of media file. This includes images, GIFs, and videos. It is best practice to store files outside of your database because of their sizes. For security, HTML files are returned as plain text.

Folders#
Folders are a way to organize your files (just like on your computer).
There is no right or wrong way to
organize your files. You can store them in whichever folder structure suits your project.

Buckets#
Buckets are distinct containers for files and folders. You can think of them like "super folders".
Generally you would create distinct buckets for different Security and Access Rules. For example, you might
keep all video files in a "video" bucket, and profile pictures in an "avatar" bucket.

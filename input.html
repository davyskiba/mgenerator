Storage
Cloud Storage makes it simple to store and serve large files.
Files#
Files can be any sort of media file. This includes images, GIFs, and videos. It is best practice to store files outside of your database because of their sizes. For security, HTML files are returned as plain text.

Buckets#
Buckets are distinct containers for files and folders. You can think of them like "super folders".
Generally you would create distinct buckets for different Security and Access Rules. For example, you might
keep all video files in a "video" bucket, and profile pictures in an "avatar" bucket.

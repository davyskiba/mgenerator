      Supabase Storage makes it simple to store and serve large files.
      Files can be any sort of media file. This includes images, GIFs, and videos. It is best practice to store files outside of your database because of their sizes. For security, HTML files are returned as plain text.
      Folders are a way to organize your files (just like on your computer). You can store them in whichever folder structure suits your project.
